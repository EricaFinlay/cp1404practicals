Clean code contains:

- appropriately written docstring and inline comments and well named variables, functions and constants
- functions that undertake only one action and thereby meet the SRP (Single Responsibility Principal)
- code that avoids repetition and is scalable to manage higher repetitions thereby ensuring DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
